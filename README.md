* The thing bringing energy to the system is called the *excitor* and the thing that vibrates is *excited*.
* The *excited* thing can be a *resonator*, a concept we will develop shortly.
* In carbon dioxide gas
  where the forces between distant molecules are relatively weak we find sound
  moves slowly at 259m/s. Of the 118 common elements, 63 are metals. That
  accounts for a wide range of physical properties, and more so if we allow alloys.
  Most metals are elastic, hard, dense, and acoustically very conductive.
